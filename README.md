# myPatientApiClient
   
  This client was created with a standard Core Web Application template + authentication for individual user
  
  The only file that was added was the index.html in the wwwroot folder.  No other changes.
  
  After the myPatientApiServer is running, then run this project and add "index.html" to the end of the localhost line the top of the browser.
